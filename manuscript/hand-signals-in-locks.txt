## Hand Signals in Locks

### Narrowboat steerer and crew need to communicate when working locks.

Tom and I had chatted about it. We had two weeks together on the boat and were taking it in turns to steer and work the locks, so we understood the process from both sides. We developed a way of checking with one another that it was OK to proceed as we went through locks.

It went like this: Enter the lock, then before the crew does anything with the paddles give an interrogative 'thumbs up' to the steerer. If all is well the steerer responds with an affirmative 'thumbs up' and the windlass turns. Our cunning plan was to do things from then on in four stages - first paddle half up then signal; then paddle fully up before proceeding to the next one. We figured this would give the steerer enough time to prepare for the effect of the water movement in the lock.

It all went brilliantly until I picked up an entire mountain-bike tyre around the propeller when entering a particularly deep lock in the pouring rain. I only became aware of the problem after the first paddle was raised half way and I realised that I was having some difficulty counteracting the rush of water (we were going up). I couldn't understand what the problem was, and stupidly answered the next query with a tentative 'thumbs up'.

Mistake! Tom opened up fully and whizzed across to the other gate. The boat was pushed right back into the lower gate. I became pre-occupied with holding the tiller over to protect the rudder and fiddling with the morse control to work out what was going wrong. You will guess what happened next - the boat suddenly decided to rush forwards!

Tom was just about to open the second paddle as my surge forwards began. He asked with a 'thumbs up' and I realised that we had no agreed 'nooooo!' signal. I just shook my head vigorously (having no hands free) and crashed forward into the gates. Tom looked bemused and watched as I slowly rose in the water - squished against the gate.

No harm was done, and after the gates were opened I hauled the boat to the side, went down the weed-hatch and cut off the offending article. We talked about what had gone wrong.

I should have realised what had happened sooner (my propeller had become a blob of rubber - a 'non-propeller'!), and Tom should have been watching me more closely. More importantly, we had not agreed on any sort of 'eek' or 'shut all paddles and come and see what has gone wrong' signals. If we had had these in our repertoire a nasty experience would have become 'just one of those things'.

It all emphasises the fact that the man with the windlass is in control during locking, and that agreed hand signals are essential. (I think that: 'OK'; Help!'; and 'shut everything' ought to cover most eventualities.)

You live and learn!
