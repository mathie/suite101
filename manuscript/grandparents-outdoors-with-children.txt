## Grandparents Outdoors with Children

### How to encourage the development of a love of nature.

The eyes light up. An exotic creature has been caught. It goes straight in the bucket along with all the other trophies.

This is a five-year old out on the beach with his grandfather. The 'exotic creature' was a small shore crab, and the 'trophies' were oddly shaped stones and bits of seaweed, but this is how a love of nature begins. The light in the eyes shows the process has begun, but it is only a start. How can it be nurtured?

More of the same is the answer. More scrounging about outdoors. More collecting of weird and wonderful trophies, and anything that catches the eye of the young explorer must be praised by the grandfather.

I am saying 'him' and 'grandfather' for convenience. It might equally be 'her' and 'grandmother', or any permutation. But I have deliberately skipped a generation because the sad fact is that in many families the parents belong to a generation that has missed out. They have grown up surrounded by other distractions - they missed their opportunity to 'muck about' outdoors. And more than that, it is grandparents who have the time and energy to become playmates.

A love of nature can't be taught. It needs to be allowed to grow and blossom over time. The 'significant adult' can encourage the early stages by tagging along with the explorer and enthusing about the trophies.

A real danger is that the adult involved will have his or her own agenda while mucking about outdoors. He or She will be on the look-out for things that seem wonderful to them. They will have become far too familiar with the 'common stuff', and can easily forget how everything new is a revelation to the young naturalist. A snail, a worm, an ant through a magnifying glass - these are just as exciting to a young child as glimpse of a rarity might be to the adult. Never 'it's only a worm', always 'wow' - 'look how it wriggles', and 'can I have a feel'.

Being there at the start of the process is a privilege, but it is also a duty. If we are not careful we could end up with another generation divorced from nature.
