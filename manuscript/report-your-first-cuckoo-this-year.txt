## Report Your First Cuckoo This Year

Our UK cuckoos are still in Africa at the moment (February 2013), but on their
way back. The BTO fitted satellite-tracking devices to a number of birds in
2011 and 2012, and a map of their travels together with the latest news of
their locations can be seen on the 'Tracking Cuckoos to Africa and back again'
web page. The Cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) is one of the UK's fastest declining
migrants, with numbers dropping 65% since the 1980s.

The reasons for their decline are still unclear, and when the full picture
emerges it will probably be a combination of factors including the earlier
nesting of their host species. Dunnocks, Pied Wagtails, and Reed Warblers are
now nesting five or six days earlier than in the past. The exact timing of
cuckoo arrival in the UK is part of the information we need to know in order to
understand the problems they are facing, and this is where amateur biological
recorders can come in.

When you hear your first cuckoo this year you can go to the BirdTrack website
to submit a 'one-off' record - or if you would like to make a cash donation to
the cuckoo tracking project at the same time you could do it by texting from
your phone.
