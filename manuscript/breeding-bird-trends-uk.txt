## Breeding Bird Trends UK

### Biological recording has built a picture of how bird populations have changed over the last few decades.

If you get involved in the Big Garden Birdwatch, or are taking part in the Big
Schools Birdwatch you might like to see what records like yours tell us.

The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) has put together the results of their
surveys from 1966 to 2010 to show: 'trends in numbers and demography for UK
breeding birds'. You can find information by species, or look at summaries of
the Key Findings.

This sort of long term analysis allows us to identify which species are in
trouble in the UK, but equally importantly it uses thousands of individual
records to give us the 'big picture'. It will: 'help conservation organisations
to target their resources more effectively'.

At the end of the final page of this comprehensive report it says: 'we hope
that users of this report will provide feedback on how it can be improved. We
will welcome comments on any aspect of this report, as they will help us to
produce a better and more useful next edition.' You can email your comments
from the website.
