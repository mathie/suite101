### How to tie the essential knots

![Round Turn and Two Half Hitches](images/knots-for-narrowboaters.jpg)

Firstly you need one sort of knot to tie the boat to bollards or mooring pins when you moor up. If you moor by passing a rope through a mooring ring or chain before bringing it back on board, you will need a different knot to secure it round a cleat.

Whole books have been written about knots. There are hundreds to choose from, but learning the three or four shown here will cover all eventualities.

#### Round Turn and Two Half Hitches

Use this knot to tie the boat up to a bollard. It will not slip and can easily be undone.

First of all, what are turns? - A turn, B round turn, C two round turns

Pass the rope round the bollard (turn 'B' in the image above), then do two half hitches shown in the image below without the turn.

If this is not clear watch the YouTube video! - round turn and two half hitches.

#### Figure of Eight Cleat Hitch

If the mooring rope has been passed through a ring on the bank (either a mooring ring or a mooring chain), and then brought back on board to be secured, you will need the 'figure of eight' knot. The name says it all. Finish it off with a half hitch. Watch the YouTube video of figure eight cleat hitch - figure eight cleat hitch.

#### Bowline

This useful knot will make a loop at the end of a line. It will not tighten up around the bollard and can easily be slipped off and undone later. The only problem with using this knot to secure the boat to a bollard is that anyone will find it easy to slip it off the bollard, so it can't be used when there is a danger of passers-by interfering! Having said that, it is an ideal way to make a loop for dropping over a bollard or post when mooring temporarily. There are all sorts of ways to remember how to tie this knot - 'the rabbit came out of the hole, went once round the tree, and then back down the hole', springs to mind. Watch the YouTube video - bowline.

#### Canalman's Hitch

This is not an essential knot, but it is perfect for attaching the centre-line temporarily to a bollard when you are waiting to go through a lock or stopping to make a cup of tea. Almost impossible to describe other than: 'two turns round then a sort of twirly one looped over' - it is probably best to watch the video.

Since this knot is only going to be used for temporary mooring the fact that it is very easy to tie and can be quickly undone outweighs the fact that it is not as secure as the 'round turn and two half hitches'.

It is a good idea to practise these knots with rope and a bit of wood before venturing onto the canal.
