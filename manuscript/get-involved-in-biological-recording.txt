## Get Involved in Biological Recording

### A number of articles to point you in the right direction.

Amateur Biological Recorders play an important role in providing scientists
with data, and children can benefit hugely when they are involved.

#### No Previous Experience Necessary

I want to stress the fact that there are recording schemes out there that do
not require much in the way of identification skill (TheWildOutside is a good
example), and those that do usually provide a lot of help (such as OPAL ). RSPB
surveys (Big Garden and Schools Birdwatch) are well known and they are also
easy to work with.

#### Amateur Recorders who want to Specialise

For those who want to get involved in more specialist recording there are many
other schemes and sources of information, and I try to highlight useful
websites and new apps when I come across them.

There are articles to help you do a mistletoe survey, or record raft spiders,
or keep an eye open to see which berries birds prefer in winter. Alternatively
you could look out for signs of disease when birds come to your feeder, or
report diseased ash trees you notice when out walking.

I am trying to get more people involved in citizen science. The data produced
is very valuable, and getting out and about is good for you!
