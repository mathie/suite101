## Why are Woolly Bears Important?

Professor Simon Leather of Imperial College London tells us how Chris Packham 'got hooked by natural history' as a youngster by his 'experiences of rearing (or attempting to rear) woolly bear caterpillars'. In his blog ('where have all the woolly bears gone') Simon goes on to say how these same caterpillars (and the adult Tiger Moth) have inspired him and others in a similar way.

I would like to go one step further to point out the benefits of simply being outdoors in nature as a child, whether spectacular wildlife is encountered or not. Taking children out to help with biological recording projects is an excellent way to get them involved. Working to a real purpose outdoors will give them a taste for nature whether they encounter spectacular wildlife or not.
