## Why I Love Narrowboats

### Musing on the reasons for my narrowboat addiction.

Maybe it is the self-sufficiency of cocooned travel, maybe the gathering of quiet competences like threading the twenty ton needle into a lock. Perhaps the lost backwaters, or the boaters' camaraderie. Cups of tea and the smells of bacon and coal fires. Who knows what contributes to this obsession.

Short trips along the canal for a couple of days and then back are enough at first, but soon there is the need to range further afield and be able to branch off in new directions. To wander around a bit and not have to plan the trip. To be able to take this or that turning on a whim and see where it leads.

And then there is the wildlife. Narrowboats are ponderously unthreatening and the setting is ofter unkempt and rural. There are corridors of hedgerows for mile upon mile offering tasty insects and autumn fruits galore. Birds and butterflies, frogs and ferrets. Kingfishers by day and bats by night. Never a dull moment for the naturalist, and always the promise of the unexpected.
