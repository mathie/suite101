## Setting off from a Mooring

### A foolproof way to leave the bank in a narrowboat.

Some people (with a 'trained' crew) simply cast off and pull away. The crew untie all ropes, stow them aboard and hop on. The steerer then simply drives away. I don't like to do this for a number of reasons:

* the first reason is that I usually have people on board who are new to narrowboating, so I am worried in case they do something weird or put themselves in danger. I imagine them untying, tangling the rope, trowing it into the canal by accident, pushing off and then leaping away from the bank etc..

* the second reason is that the bank might well hide obstructions or be very shallow. In these cases the boat simply ploughs into the whatever-it-is or runs aground.

* and the third is that the rear of the boat will inevitably press against the edge for a while and the propeller-wash will erode the bank.

My (foolproof?) method is to go off backwards. I make sure that the centre-line is securely attached, then undo front and rear. With the engine warmed-up and running (in neutral!). I then undo the centre-line and walk along stowing it along the roof, so the end is easy to hand. Push the rear end off the bank and step aboard. Wait a bit until the stern is in clear water, then reverse into the canal. When sufficiently far out I go into forward gear and cruise away.

This method will always work, unless there is a strong wind blowing towards the bank. In that case there is always the pole - or a cup of tea!
