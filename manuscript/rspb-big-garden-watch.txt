## RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch

### The 'Worlds Biggest Wildlife Survey' is about to take place once again.

In 1979 junior members of the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds)
were asked to count the birds in their garden. This survey was featured on Blue
Peter (a BBC children's television programme) and over 30,000 children took
part. The annual survey carried on as a children's event until 2001 when adults
were included for the first time. This year - over the weekend of 26-27 January
2013 - the 34th annual 'Big Garden Birdwatch' is expected to involve over half
a million people across the UK, giving the RSPB a 'snapshot' of bird numbers.

There have been a number of interesting changes since 1979. Here are some of
the results:

* Woodpigeon numbers up 800%

* Blue Tit numbers up 20%

* House Sparrows down 33%

* Robins down 32%

* House Sparrows down 33%

* Starlings down 80%

Having this information has allowed informed conservation work. As the RSPB
says: The decline of birds like starlings over the last 30 years has been
alarming (but) that has been the first step in helping to put things right.

Find all you need to know about taking part and watch the birds in your garden
for one hour on the weekend of 26 - 27 January 2013.
