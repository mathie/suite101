## Why are Mistle Thrushes Disappearing from UK Gardens?

Mistle Thrushes are in 'rapid decline' in the UK. There were 222,500 breeding
territories twenty years ago and the results for ATLAS surveys of 2007-11 will
give the current figure. The BTO suggests there was a 25-50% drop in breeding
numbers between 1966 and 2010. Mistle Thrushes eat insects, worms, seeds, and
berries - so people who observe which berries Mistle Thrushes seem to prefer
might lead to sympathetic planting in the future, but that will only be of use
in the winter.

Interviewed about the decline Jo Keene (RSPB) told John Humphrys (BBC News)
that there are: 'a few theories relating to the lack of flying insects at the
right time of year and some theories around climate change' to explain the
decline. The lack of flying insects last year might be an example of the
problems Mistle Thrushes encounter in one bad year, but the evidence so far
seems to suggest there is a steady decline that we do not understand. The more
information we can get, year on year, about Mistle Thrush breeding success: the
more likely we are to come up with an explanation.

Only when we know what is going on might we be able to do something about it!
