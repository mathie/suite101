## Oak Budburst UK and Jean Combes OBE

### Amateur recorders' contribution to science. Join them!

Dr Tim Sparks, an environmental scientist at the Centre for Ecology and
Hydrology at Monks Wood, has compiled a list of the dates when the buds on oak
trees in the UK first open.

This record begins in the famous 'Natural History of Selborne' (by Gilbert
White), and by searching the literature Sparks was able to fill in the data up
to the middle of the twentieth century. Then he hit a gap - exactly for the
period when this sort of information would be most useful. Luckily he found an
amateur biologist, Jean Combes, who has kept a record the date the first oak
buds burst since 1947. Her information completes the picture so far, and we now
know how this date has changed over a very long period of time. You can watch a
video explaining all this, and look at this page to 'be inspired'.

Natures Calendar is the home for thousands of volunteers who record the signs
of the seasons where they live: 'You dont have to be an expert to take part,
and lots of help is given, including a free downloadable nature identification
booklet'. There are recording schemes for many animal species, and other
surveys to record seasonal plant events.

So get out this year and get involved: 'this kind of recording has moved from
being a leisure hobby to a crucial source of evidence as to how our wildlife is
responding to climate change'.
