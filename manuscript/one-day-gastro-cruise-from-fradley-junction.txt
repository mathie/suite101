## One Day Gastro-Cruise from Fradley Junction

### An easy day along the Coventry Canal and back, with a good pub lunch thrown in.

This is the third short cruise I will cover along the narrow canals of the Midlands.  The first was from Stone to Great Haywood, and the second from Great Haywood to Fradley Junction. This one takes you out along the beautiful Coventry Canal as far as Hopwas and then back again to Fradley.
A very good pub lunch is possible at Hopwas, and the timings I suggest make this a possible 'gastro-cruise'. With a leisurely pace the whole trip can be done in around nine hours, including a two hour lunch-break.

Leave Fradley Junction opposite 'The Swan' turning onto the Coventry Canal, and immediately pass through a swing bridge. After an hour or so you pass  Streethay Wharf. Continue beyond Huddlesford to arrive at Hopwas at midday (assuming you started sometime around 9.00 am).  This would be a good time to hop off the boat and investigate the two Pubs - the  'Tame Otter' and the 'Red Lion'.  You need to go a couple of miles further along the Coventry Canal to turn just before Bonehill Bridge, and this will take an hour or so with or without your crew (who might mutiny and stay in the pub for preprandials!).

After lunch it is a straightforward run back to arrive something like three hours after leaving the pub.
