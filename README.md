# Selected Articles from Suite 101

This is a collection of my late father in law's articles that he published to <https://suite.io/>. I used [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) to turn the book into a print-ready PDF, then used [Blurb](http://www.blurb.co.uk/) to produce a couple of print copies for a Christmas gift. I have to confess, I haven't seen the print results, but the whole process was remarkably painless. Fun, almost!

Since I might as well, I've published the book up on Leanpub: [Selected Articles from Suite 101](https://leanpub.com/johnblatchford). It's available for free, but if you buy a copy, I'll donate the money to John's favourite charity, in his memory.

At some point, I should write a blog post on the workflow of going from copy'n'pasting the source material, all the way to producing a printed copy. Self (or 'other', in this case) publishing is easy and fun and I hadn't really appreciated just how low the bar is nowadays.
