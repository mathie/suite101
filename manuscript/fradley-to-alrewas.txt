# Fradley to Alrewas

This is the third of a series of day cruises from Stone in Staffordshire down the Trent and Mersey Canal. The first covers Stone to Great Haywood and the second takes you on to Fradley Junction. If you moored overnight just before Shade House Lock as suggested you have two locks before you pass The Swan and the turn onto the Coventry Canal (see 'a one-day gastro-cruise from Fradley'), then another three to get you out onto a short uninterrupted stretch of the canal heading for Common Lock half a mile further on.  Half a mile later there are good moorings just before Bagnall Lock, and you should take advantage of them. At some stage on this one-day cruise you will need to pass through Bagnall Lock in order to use the 70ft winding hole between bridges 49 and 48. In my opinion it is best to get the turn over with immediately and come back through Bagnall Lock to moor pointing in the right direction for the return trip.
Alrewas is a pretty village with lots to explore, and the National Memorial Arboretum is not far away.

A stroll round the village and either a pub-lunch at The George and Dragon or a walk to the arboretum make this short hop from Fradley Junction into a full day outing, with the possibility of a visit to The Swan when you return in the evening.

You will have worked through 14 locks during the day and probably deserve a pint!
