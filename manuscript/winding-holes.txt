## Winding Holes

That only leaves the business of turning a narrrowboat around to go back the way you came. And since the canal is almost always narrower than the length of the boat this requires some forward planning. What you need to locate on your map is a suitable 'Winding Hole'. Canal maps show the location of these turning places, and some give the dimensions - it is no use trying to turn a 70ft boat in a 60ft winding hole!

The idea is to drive slowly into the "notch" of the winding hole so that the front of the boat touches the re-enforced bank (or goes gently aground in some places). With the front effectively anchored in place gently engage forward gear and use the tiller to push the boat round. When ready simply reverse out of the hole and drive off in the other direction. It will often take more than a simple "in, turn, reverse, continue" and require several "bites" - but there is plenty of time.

Things can become a bit complicated if there is too much wind, and it is important to remember that the front of the boat will be pushed more than the rear half, and to use that knowledge to help.

Although it is tempting you should not use marina entrances as turning circles, but it would be legitimate to go in and buy fuel (or gas etc.) then leave again to set off in the other direction :-)
