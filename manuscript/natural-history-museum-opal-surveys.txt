## Natural History Museum OPAL Surveys

### Getting young people interested in nature.

The Natural History Museum in London offers a number of surveys that you can
get involved with. They range from air quality to bug counting (quality of air
and water, distribution of invertebrates, importance of hedges, and ways in
which we affect our climate). The venture is called OPAL (Open Air
Laboratories) and it: 'aims to create and inspire a new generation of
nature-lovers by getting people to explore, study, enjoy and protect their
local environment'. It is open to anyone and encourages people from all
backgrounds to get back in touch with nature. Easy-to-follow survey
instructions are provided, and there is a lot of support available.

One type of survey (BugHunt) focusses on six invertebrates. It is suitable for
all - including children - and as well as gathering valuable scientific
information it has the potential to both get young people 'out and about', and
to foster an interest in 'creepy crawlies'. There is a detailed explanation of
these surveys online (with a video showing some useful collecting techniques).

One example of the creatures involve in BugHunt is the Leopard Slug (Limus
maximus).
