## Urban Pollinator Surveys

### Let Experts Study the Insect Pollinators in your Garden

People in Bristol, Leeds, and Reading can help a major survey by letting the
experts visit their garden.

If you live in one of these three cities and have a garden with a lot of
flowers you might be able to get involved with the 'Urban Pollinators Survey'.
They aim to look at 100 gardens in each city, and you do not have to go out and
look at insects yourself - simply invite them into your garden and let experts
do the work! They will visit you each month between late April and September
and spend half an hour in selected gardens looking at the insects and plants.
You can read more about the Urban Pollinators Project here.

This survey has been running for 2 years already, and 2013 will be the last
year - get involved if you can.
