## Japanese Knotweed Seminar UK

### "Once upon a time, this green and pleasant land was free from invasive species..." Well, that's not quite true...

No, the plants and wildlife found in the UK have all come from elsewhere (if
you go back far enough in time). And it is true to say that - given enough time
- all the new invasive plants and animals will settle down into a new
equilibrium with what is left of our current native species. The problem is
that in doing so much of our current biodiversity will be lost.

Find Out More PlantTracker (available free for iPads and iPhones) is from the
Environment Agency and the NatureLocator team at Bristol University. It is a
useful tool for would-be amateur plant recorders, allows you to identify a
number of UK invasives, photograph them, and then send your record
(geo-located) to experts.

I discuss Himalayan Balsam and Giant Hogweed in one of my articles in the 'UK
Biological Recording' channel here at Suite101, and Floating Pennywort in an
article in the 'English Narrowboats and Canals' channel.

#### Japanese Knotweed

Japanese Knotweed (Fallopia japonica) is another of these very successful
invasive plants. It grows and spreads very well in the UK, and in doing so it
out-competes native plants and alters habitats affecting wildlife as well. It
is one of the other invasive species dealt with by the PlantTracker app. If you
want to find about more about Japanese Knotweed and other UK invasive plants
there is a seminar being organised in Manchester on Wednesday 22nd May 2013
('Invasive Plants - Myths and Legends').
