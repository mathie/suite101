## Narrowboat Handling in English Narrow Locks Single-handed

### A safe way for one person to work through narrow locks on English canals.

Narrowboats just fit into the narrow locks of the English canal system. The shorter ones leave plenty of room at front and back, but there is never more than a few inches to spare from side-to-side. Novices often struggle to enter open locks without a few bangs and scrapes, and the entire crew is usually involved in working the lock paddles and gates, but many experienced boaters manage it all single-handed and make it look simple!

I have watched, read, and experimented with our own narrowboat on the narrow canals and locks of Staffordshire, and I think I have developed a safe way of working the boat through the lock single-handed.

####Working through narrow locks single-handed

There is always a safe temporary mooring beside a lock (going up or down), and I always tie-up there to begin the process. Most narrowboats have a 'center-line' attached securely to the middle of the roof and long enough to reach the helmsman. This line will hold the boat securely against the bank while the lock is inspected - if you are going uphill you might consider tying the bow-rope as well so that water rushing out from the lock doesn't drag the bows out and risk the boat heeling over!

Walk up to the lock with your windlass and check the water level. If necessary open the appropriate paddle(s) to fill or empty the lock and then wait until the gate(s) can be opened. Once this has been done return to the boat and head into the lock.

Setting off from the bank is best done by untying the center-line and then walking along the bank to push the front end out towards the middle of the canal. This will force the rear of the boat in towards the bank, and there is plenty of time to walk back (with the end of the rope) and step on board. Wait until the front end is well into the canal, then move very slowly forwards and enter the lock. Steering pivots the boat somewhere around the middle (where the center-line is attached), so the front will need to go across the canal beyond the lock entrance before steering can line the boat up squarely with the lock. Enter the lock very slowly and give a burst of reverse to stop when in place.

What happens next depends on whether you are going up or down. Going down is easiest so we'll start with that.

#### Going Down

Step off the boat with the windlass and center-line and close the lower gate then locate a suitable bollard alongside the middle of the boat. Look around and check where the ladder is set into the side of the lock (you will be climbing down it shortly!). The ideal setup is where there is a suitable bollard on the same side as the ladder, but if that is not the case go for whichever is nearest to the middle of the boat. Tie the rope to the bollard with a secure knot that can easily be undone in a few moments.

Walk to the lower gates and open the paddle on the same side as the rope you have just tied on with. Do this slowly and watch the effect on the boat. When the boat is going down return to the rope and untie it - use the rope to keep the boat steady in the middle of the lock. The front end should not be allowed to bash into the front gates, and it is vital that the rear end is kept forward of the 'cill' beneath the lower gate. The position of this 'cill' is always marked on the stonework of the lock, but it will not be visible until the lock is empty. Letting the boat get back so that it is over the 'cill' as the lock empties can result in damage or worse, so keep an eye on it at all times.

When the lock is empty open the gates and climb down the ladder on to the roof with the rope and windlass. Walk along the roof to the steering position and motor out to moor up again temporarily. Walk back and put the paddles down and close the gates. Return to the boat and continue cruising.

#### Going Up

The difference here is that you enter an empty lock and have to climb up the ladder with your rope and windlass before you can begin. Close the gates as before, and locate a suitable bollard to tie up to temporarily.

The upper gates often have paddles set into the gate itself, and the problem with these is that the water pours in above the level of the boat - so open the gates set in the side of the lock first!

When the boat begins to rise gently return to the rope and keep the boat steady as before. Finally open the gates, motor out, tie up, and return to close the paddles and gates as before.

#### Suggestions

Practice each stage of working through locks while you have a competent crew on board - eventually do it all yourself, but having the crew stand-by in case of problems. (Watch a YouTube video I have made to show me practising the 'boat bit', while Chris works the lock.)

Climbing up and down ladders with a rope and windlass can be tricky, so it is a good idea to tuck them securely into a belt to leave both hands free. Walking on the wet roof of a narrowboat requires secure footware with a safe grip, and it is best to keep the rear half of the roof as uncluttered as possible.

Only solo boaters really need to be able to work through locks single-handed, but it is a useful skill to have. In the event of the crew being unable to help for whatever reason it will allow the cruise to continue. It also means that novice crew can be 'shown the ropes' in the first couple of locks of a voyage, with the 'skipper' demonstrating rather than trying to explain everything.
