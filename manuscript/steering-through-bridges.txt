## Steering Through Bridges

### How to avoid crashing into the brickwork

Bridge openings are often alarmingly narrow, and the arch can be very low. Add a sharp bend with the possibility of a boat approaching from the other direction and it makes sense to go slowly enough to work out the best approach and be able to stop if the front of a boat appears in the gap.

Wherever possible you should position the boat so that it "lines up" with the parallel edges of the bridge. What I mean is do not approach at an angle and expect to turn at the last minute - boats do not steer like cars, and just because the front fits nicely does not mean the rest will!

If the approach feels right, and there is nothing coming the other way, the next concerns are how much gap to leave either side and will the height of the opening cause problems (superstructure and chimney can catch the bridge if you are not careful). Passing under a bridge missing the towpath side by 9 inches or so is usually recommended. But to do this accurately you will have to lean out a bit and watch the side of the boat and the edge of the bridge. Right-handed steerers will find this easy when the towpath is on the left, but it is much more difficult when it is on the right. There are a couple of ways of making things easier:

* practise steering with the left hand (and this DOES take practice!)

* or step up on something to get a clear view along both sides at once. A few boats have a "steering step" for this, but if there is not one a solid box will do

All nicely lined up and approaching with just the right gap visible. What speed?

Remember "no gear, no steer". Never panic and throw it into reverse. You should be going slowly enough already, and engaging reverse gear, while slowing you down a bit, will remove all directional control from the helm. Going into neutral too soon should also be avoided for the same reason, although some people like to stop the propeller turning as the back of the boat goes through in case there is rubbish lurking under the bridge and the propeller picks it up.

With nasty bends it is a good idea to sound the horn and hope that anyone coming the other way hears it in time, but a sensible additional precaution is to reduce speed early and pass through more slowly than you would with an unobstructed view.
