## Be Prepared -- Giant Hornets Coming

### Amateur biological recorders can help specialists by keeping an eye open for an invasive species that is expected to arrive soon.

The Non-native Species Secretariat has lots of information about invasive plant
and animal species that have already arrived in the UK, and there are useful
links to RISC (recording invasive species counts) where 19 species are
highlighted.

In the case of the Asian Hornet (Vespa velutina) there is a warning about a
species that is expected to arrive soon. This is an insect that will be easy to
spot when it arrives, and since it is 'a highly effective predator of insects,
including honey bees and other beneficial species' it is expected to disrupt
many of our ecosystems. The French experience (it is now well established in
France) has shown how rapidly it can spread in Europe, and if we are to have
any chance of controlling this hornet if and when it arrives here we will have
to 'nip it in the bud'.

If you see this creature the advice is: 'do not under any circumstances disturb
or provoke an active hornets nest', but: 'send in a sample to the National Bee
Unit for examination to confirm identity'. I take that to mean pick up a dead
one if you can, or kill one if you think you might get away with it! If you do
manage to get hold of one, or a decent photograph, you should send it off for a
confirmation of your identification.
