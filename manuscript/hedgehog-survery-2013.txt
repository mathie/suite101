## Hedgehog Survey 2013

There has been a lot of work done recently to find out how well hedgehogs are
doing in the UK. In 2005/6 the People's Trust for Endangered Species (via
HogWatch) collected tens of thousands of records from members of the public
across the country, and the British Hedgehog Preservation Society has a
downloadable pdf report by David Wembridge on 'The state of Britain's hedgehogs
2011'. This report points out that: 'in the early part of the last century
hedgehogs were abundant throughout Britain an estimated population of 30
million in the 1950s in 1995 the population was only about 1.5 million', and
'counts of hedgehog road casualties in the early 1990s and 2001 suggest that
numbers have fallen by as much as a half '.

There was a 'Hedgehog Hibernation Survey' in 2012 , with around 2,000 people
logging around 45,000 hedgehog sightings (one of the largest datasets about
hedgehog activity ever collected), and this site has a good map to show the
results. The 2012 survey found that hedgehog emergence from hibernation was
very different from what was recorded in the 1970s. The reasons for these
differences are unclear - so the survey will be repeated this year (2013).

If you are able to take part you should register your interest very soon, and
if your garden is suitable you might also consider giving a home to a rescued
hedgehog.
