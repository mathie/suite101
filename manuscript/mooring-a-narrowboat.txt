## Mooring a Narrowboat

### How to moor up and set off single-handed.

Whenever you approach a lock you will find a stretch of the canal set aside for temporary mooring while you prepare the lock or wait your turn. There are always a few bollards, and there should be sufficient water and a good enough bank to make this mooring easy (in theory!).

#### Mooring Single-handed

If you have a crew you will probably develop your own convenient way to moor, and if you are solo there are several ways of doing it. The following suggestions are simply my own preferred technique. The trouble with using a crew to help moor up temporarily is one of communication - in most situations I prefer to bring the boat into the bank and step off holding it stationary and letting the 'lock crew' off. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly things have a habit of changing at the last minute - another boat suddenly appears, you suddenly notice a submerged rock, the wind does something unexpected, or whatever. If plans have to suddenly be changed (seconds before reaching the bank) it is difficult to shout new instructions to confused crew members up at the pointy end, especially when you are making it up as you go along! No, I like to take the boat in and tie it up before anyone else gets off.

#### Come in Very Slowly

I usually stop the boat a few feet away from my intended mooring (by using sufficient reverse). From this dead stop I approach the bank at an angle very slowly, just tick over. At the last minute I then turn the boat so that it is almost parallel to the mooring, and with the back end swinging gently in, step off with the centre-line in my hand. It is a good idea to use a little reverse-thrust to stop the boat at this stage - but the danger here is that this might cause the rear end to push out from the bank and make stepping off difficult.

Assuming the boat is now lying parallel to the bank and almost stopped, the centre-line can be turned around a bollard somewhere near the middle of the boat, and the friction allowed to bring it to a dead halt. Slowly pull the boat along as far as a convenient bollard (level with the centre-line fixing ring on the roof), then tie off loosely. I use the boatman's knot - two turns round then a sort of twirly one looped over. At this stage I either go up to set the lock (if I am working single-handed), or let the crew off to do the heavy work.

#### Setting Off Again

Once the lock is prepared and the gates are open, I untie the centre-line and stroll to the front of the boat keeping hold of the rope. A push off at the bows will force the rear end firmly into the bank, and there is ample time to walk back to the rear, stow the centre-line neatly within reach, and get on to steer into the lock.

Setting off from the bank (i.e. not just before a lock) it is usually best to set off in reverse (See ' a foolproof method').

#### Overnight Mooring

The centre-line alone is not enough for a prolonged stop. The mooring procedure is identical to begin with, but once safely at the bank the bow and stern ropes need to be led away from the boat and tied using bollards, rings, chains or stakes. The knots are best made back on the boat rather than on the bank - a mild deterrent to any possible pranksters!

#### Loops Around Bollards

Using the centre-line to bring the boat to a halt is best done by taking a single turn around a bollard a little before the middle of the boat. The instinctive way to make this loop has the unfortunate effect of encouraging the rope to 'bite' on itself and cause a juddering halt. Best to do it the other way, so that the line to the boat is above the line back to your hand.

As with everything else to do with narrowboating the best advice is: 'Think ahead and do it slowly'.
