## Measuring Toads at Toad Crossings

### Help toads get safely across roads and measure a few.

ARGUK (Amphibian and Reptile Groups of the UK) represents more than 60
Amphibian and Reptile Groups (ARGs) based in the UK and aims to promote the
conservation of our native amphibians and reptiles.

One annual activity helps volunteers patrol 'toad-crossings'. They use buckets
to collect any frogs, toads or newts which attempt to cross roads, and safely
transport them to the destination side of the road. (See Toad-crossings in
Surrey)

This year ARGUK is asking toad patrollers if they can measure between 10 and 20
male toads each night (ToadSize 2013). They want to gather data to: 'test the
hypothesis that road mortalities during the spawning season are having a
significant impact on toad populations which may be resulting in a greater
proportion of smaller (younger) toads.
